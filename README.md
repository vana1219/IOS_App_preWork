## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My 3 favorite application is: Instagram, Amazon, Netflix.
2-3 features that make them your favorite app
1.Instagram:
I can share's someone posts to others or I can save someone's post, so I can reuse it later
I can repost some's post on my story.
I can either choose to set my account private or public. Instagram is more private social media to me.
2.Amazon:
I can save products that I like for later without losing them for future if I need to buy them in future.
It gave me similar product while I'm searching for something so I have more choices to choose.
3. Netfilx:
There is categories movies, so I get to choose whichever type of moive that I like. It make the app is more organize.
I can save movies for later
I can download movies that I like so I can watch them without using internet.

## Notes

During the time learning how to do it, trying to figured out how to drag a lables and button was a little bit hard.
Step 3 which is connect UI to logic was a little challenging too. After that, I tried to join Slack, and it helped me a lot.
Other than that, everything was obvious. It is a cool thing that I have to learn.
